## Quick Comparison Table

| Pathway | Region | Authority | Timeline | Evidence | Sample Size | Reimbursement |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **DiGA Provisional** | Germany | BfArM | 3-6 months | Pilot + RCT plan | n=30-100 | €200-784/90d (automatic) |
| **DiGA Permanent** | Germany | BfArM | 6-12 months | Completed RCT | n=200-1200 | €200-784/90d (negotiated after 12mo) |
| **FDA De Novo** | USA | FDA | 12-24 months | Pivotal RCT | n=200-500+ | Insurance/CPT codes (varies) |
| **FDA 510(k)** | USA | FDA | 3-6 months | Predicate equivalence | Varies | Insurance/CPT codes (varies) |
| **CE Mark (MDR)** | EU | Notified Body | 6-12 months | Clinical evaluation | Risk-dependent | Varies by country |

## Decision Tree

**1. Primary Market?**
- Germany → DiGA pathway
- USA → FDA pathway
- EU-wide → CE Mark

**2. Evidence Available?**
- Pilot study only → DiGA Provisional
- Completed RCT → DiGA Permanent or FDA De Novo
- Predicate device exists → FDA 510(k)

**3. Speed Priority?**
- Fastest to market → DiGA Provisional (3-6 months)
- Moderate → FDA 510(k) or CE Mark (6-12 months)
- Rigorous → FDA De Novo (12-24 months)

## Key Differences

### Evidence Requirements

**DiGA**:
- Must use validated PROMs (PHQ-9, GAD-7, KOOS, VAS)
- RCT with Standard Care control arm
- PICO framework mandatory

**FDA**:
- Clinical outcome (abstinence, symptom reduction)
- Can use "attention control" comparator
- Breakthrough Designation possible for novel mechanisms

### Reimbursement

**DiGA**: Automatic coverage by statutory health insurance (73M+ members), pricing negotiation after 12 months

**FDA**: Payer-by-payer negotiations, CPT code establishment, value-based contracts
