# Research Question Frameworks (PICOS & More)

Formulating a clear, answerable research question is the first step in any systematic review or research project. Different frameworks are suitable for different types of questions.

## 1. PICOS (Quantitative / Clinical)

Best for: Quantitative studies, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), Clinical questions.

| Component | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P** - **Population** | The patient group or problem being addressed. | Adults with Type 2 Diabetes |
| **I** - **Intervention** | The exposure, treatment, or test being investigated. | Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) |
| **C** - **Comparison** | The alternative to the intervention (placebo, standard care). | Standard Finger-prick Testing |
| **O** - **Outcome** | What you are measuring to assess the effect. | HbA1c levels, Hypoglycemic events |
| **S** - **Study Design** | The type of study appropriate for the question. | Randomized Controlled Trials |

**Example Question:** In adults with Type 2 Diabetes (**P**), does Continuous Glucose Monitoring (**I**) compared to standard finger-prick testing (**C**) reduce HbA1c levels (**O**) in Randomized Controlled Trials (**S**)?

## 2. PICOT (Time-Bound)

Adds a time component to PICOS. Useful when the duration of the intervention or observation is critical.

| Component | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P** - **Population** | Patient group. | Post-operative patients |
| **I** - **Intervention** | Treatment. | Early mobilization |
| **C** - **Comparison** | Alternative. | Standard bed rest |
| **O** - **Outcome** | Measure. | Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) incidence |
| **T** - **Time** | Duration/Timeframe. | Within 30 days of surgery |

**Example Question:** In post-operative patients (**P**), does early mobilization (**I**) compared to standard bed rest (**C**) reduce the incidence of DVT (**O**) within 30 days of surgery (**T**)?

## 3. SPICE (Qualitative / Library Science)

Best for: Qualitative research, evaluating service delivery, library science.

| Component | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S** - **Setting** | Where the study takes place. | Urban Primary Care Clinics |
| **P** - **Perspective** | For whom? (Stakeholders). | Elderly Patients |
| **I** - **Intervention** | The phenomenon of interest. | Telemedicine Consultations |
| **C** - **Comparison** | Alternative (optional). | In-person Visits |
| **E** - **Evaluation** | The result or output. | Patient Satisfaction, Accessibility |

**Example Question:** In urban primary care clinics (**S**), what are the perspectives of elderly patients (**P**) regarding telemedicine consultations (**I**) compared to in-person visits (**C**) in terms of satisfaction and accessibility (**E**)?

## 4. SPIDER (Qualitative / Mixed Methods)

Best for: Qualitative evidence synthesis, focusing on samples and phenomena rather than interventions.

| Component | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **S** - **Sample** | The group being studied. | Junior Doctors |
| **P** - **Phenomenon of Interest** | The behavior or experience. | Burnout and Stress |
| **I** - **Design** | Study methodology. | Interviews, Focus Groups |
| **D** - **Evaluation** | Outcome measures (subjective). | Coping mechanisms, Work-life balance |
| **R** - **Research Type** | Type of research. | Qualitative, Mixed Methods |

**Example Question:** What are the experiences of burnout (**P**) among junior doctors (**S**) and how does it affect their work-life balance (**E**), as reported in qualitative studies (**R**) using interviews (**I**)?

## 5. Boolean Search Logic

Once you have your components, use Boolean operators to combine them into a search string for databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, etc.).

### Operators

*   **AND**: Narrows results. Both terms must be present.
    *   *Example:* `Diabetes AND "Continuous Glucose Monitoring"`
*   **OR**: Broadens results. Either term can be present. Synonyms.
    *   *Example:* `"Continuous Glucose Monitoring" OR CGM OR "Flash Glucose Monitoring"`
*   **NOT**: Excludes results. The term must not be present. (Use with caution).
    *   *Example:* `Diabetes NOT "Type 1"`

### Building a Search String (from PICOS)

1.  **Concept 1 (Population):** `("Type 2 Diabetes" OR T2DM OR "Non-insulin dependent diabetes")`
2.  **Concept 2 (Intervention):** `("Continuous Glucose Monitoring" OR CGM OR "Glucose Sensor")`
3.  **Concept 3 (Outcome):** `(HbA1c OR "Glycated Hemoglobin" OR Hypoglycemia)`

**Final String:**
`("Type 2 Diabetes" OR T2DM) AND ("Continuous Glucose Monitoring" OR CGM) AND (HbA1c OR Hypoglycemia)`

### Tips
*   Use **"quotation marks"** for exact phrases.
*   Use **(parentheses)** to group synonyms joined by OR.
*   Use **truncation*** (e.g., `diabet*`) to catch variations (diabetes, diabetic).
