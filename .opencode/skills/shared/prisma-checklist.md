# PRISMA 2020 Checklist

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement is designed to help authors prepare a transparent account of why the review was done, what the authors did, and what they found.

## Section 4: Results

| Item # | Topic | Description | Reported on Page # |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **16a** | **Study selection** | Describe the results of the search and selection process, from the number of records identified in the search to the number of studies included in the review, ideally using a flow diagram. | |
| **16b** | **Study selection** | Cite studies that might appear to meet the inclusion criteria, but which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded. | |
| **17** | **Study characteristics** | Cite each included study and present its characteristics. | |
| **18** | **Risk of bias in studies** | Present assessments of risk of bias for each included study. | |
| **19** | **Results of individual studies** | For all outcomes, present, for each included study, the summary statistics for each group (where appropriate) and an effect estimate and its precision, ideally using structured tables or plots. | |
| **20a** | **Results of syntheses** | For each synthesis, briefly summarise the characteristics and risk of bias among contributing studies. | |
| **20b** | **Results of syntheses** | Present results of all statistical syntheses conducted. If meta-analysis was done, present for each the summary estimate and its precision (e.g. confidence/credible interval) and measures of statistical heterogeneity. If comparing groups, describe the direction of the effect. | |
| **20c** | **Results of syntheses** | Present results of all investigations of possible causes of heterogeneity among study results. | |
| **20d** | **Results of syntheses** | Present results of all sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the robustness of the synthesized results. | |
| **21** | **Reporting biases** | Present assessments of risk of bias due to missing results (arising from reporting biases) for each synthesis assessed. | |
| **22** | **Certainty of evidence** | Present assessments of certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for each outcome assessed. | |

## Tips for Using This Checklist

1.  **Start Early**: Use this checklist at the protocol stage to ensure you are planning to collect all necessary information.
2.  **Be Explicit**: When reporting, clearly state where in the document each item is addressed (e.g., "Methods section, paragraph 2").
3.  **Modifications**: If you modify the checklist or omit items, provide a rationale in your methods section.
4.  **Extensions**: Be aware of PRISMA extensions for specific types of reviews (e.g., PRISMA-ScR for scoping reviews, PRISMA-DTA for diagnostic test accuracy).
