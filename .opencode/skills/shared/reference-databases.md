# Research Reference Databases & Tools

A curated list of essential resources for medical research, algorithm development, and validation.

## 1. Literature Databases

Where to find peer-reviewed papers and clinical evidence.

*   **PubMed (MEDLINE):** The primary source for biomedical literature.
    *   *URL:* [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
*   **IEEE Xplore:** Best for engineering, signal processing, and biomedical device technology.
    *   *URL:* [ieeexplore.ieee.org](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)
*   **Google Scholar:** Broad search across all disciplines. Good for finding grey literature.
    *   *URL:* [scholar.google.com](https://scholar.google.com/)
*   **Web of Science / Scopus:** High-quality citation indexing. Good for finding seminal papers.
*   **Cochrane Library:** The gold standard for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
    *   *URL:* [cochranelibrary.com](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/)

## 2. Code & Repositories

Where to find open-source implementations and share code.

*   **GitHub:** The largest host of source code. Look here for paper implementations.
    *   *URL:* [github.com](https://github.com/)
*   **GitLab:** Alternative to GitHub, often used for private enterprise repositories.
*   **Papers with Code:** Links research papers to their official code implementations.
    *   *URL:* [paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/)

## 3. Medical Datasets

Open-access data for training and testing algorithms.

*   **PhysioNet:** The largest repository of complex physiological signals (ECG, EEG, ICU data).
    *   *Key Datasets:* MIMIC-IV (ICU clinical data), MIT-BIH (Arrhythmia).
    *   *URL:* [physionet.org](https://physionet.org/)
*   **MIMIC-IV:** Massive database of de-identified health data associated with ~40,000 critical care patients.
*   **UK Biobank:** Large-scale biomedical database containing genetic and health information from half a million UK participants.
*   **Kaggle Datasets:** Variety of user-uploaded datasets, including medical imaging (Chest X-ray, MRI).

## 4. Research Tools

Tools to streamline the research process.

*   **Connected Papers:** Visual tool to explore the graph of related papers. Helps find missed citations.
    *   *URL:* [connectedpapers.com](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
*   **Mendeley / Zotero:** Reference management software. Essential for organizing citations and generating bibliographies.
*   **Covidence / Rayyan:** Tools for screening abstracts during systematic reviews.

## 5. Reporting Standards

Guidelines to ensure your research is reported correctly.

*   **EQUATOR Network:** The main hub for all health research reporting guidelines.
    *   *URL:* [equator-network.org](https://www.equator-network.org/)
*   **PRISMA:** For Systematic Reviews (see `prisma-checklist.md`).
*   **CONSORT:** For Randomized Controlled Trials.
*   **STROBE:** For Observational Studies (Cohort, Case-Control).
*   **STARD:** For Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.
*   **TRIPOD:** For Prediction Models (Machine Learning).
